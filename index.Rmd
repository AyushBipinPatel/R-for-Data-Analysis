## Pre-workshop setup

Hello! Here is the minimum setup you would need to get the most out of the workshop. Please check if you have these minimum requirements or higher, either are fine. In case you don't, follow the links to set it up.

  > A recent version of R (>=3.9.0), which is available for free at https://cran.r-project.org/

<br>

   > A recent version of RStudio Desktop (>=1.3.0), available for free at https://www.rstudio.com/download (RStudio Desktop Open Source License)
   
<br>

  > The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command line:

```{r code_installpackages, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "shiny", "flexdashboard"))
```


## Workshop Outline^[The slides will be updated a day before the class]

This workshop is aimed to train participants in using R for their day-to-day data analyses. This workshop will train participants in the tidyverse approach.

### Introduction to R

In this section the participants will learn about basics of R programming using some base R methods along with some fundamental concepts of objects and functions.

_Slides_: [Introduction to R](https://ayushbipinpatel.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/introduction-to-r.html)

### Data wrangling

This section will equip the participants with data wrangling skills using the {dplyr} package. This is where the tidyverse journey begins for the participants.

### Data Visualization using ggplot2

In their next step the participants will be introduced to {ggplot2}. This is where they will learn to make charts to communicate their data insights.

### Factors and Strings

In this section the participants will be learn fundamental string manipulation. Additionally, they will learn how to handle factors and categorical data. 

_Slides_: [Strings and Factors](https://ayushbipinpatel.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/strings-and-factors.html)

### Handling dates and time

Here the participants will be introduced to the package lubridate. They will learn about handling date time objects and fundamental operations on these objects.

_Slides_: [Time is a mystery](https://ayushbipinpatel.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/handle-time.html)

### Functions and Functional Programming

The participants will learn how to define custom functions in R. Additionally, they will be introduced to the {purrr} for functional programming.

_Slides_: [Functional Yet?](https://ayushbipinpatel.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/functions-and-functional-programming.html)

### Data import

Learner will be exposed to functions, using which they can import and access data from excel and Bigquery.

_Slides_: [Get me the data](https://ayushbipinpatel.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/data-import.html)

###  Rmarkdown

Learners will be introduced to Rmarkdown. Life will never be same again. They will learn how to use Rmarkdown for creating data driven reports.
