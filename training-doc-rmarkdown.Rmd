Hello! This is a Rmd document.

In Rmd documents you can include your text, code and output.

Following are some useful markdown syntax

# Heading

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

__This text will be rendered bold__ and **So will this**

_This text will be rendered italics_ and *So will this*


You can also make lists:

Following is the way to create a page break:

-------- | --------
value1   |  value2
Value3   |  value4
